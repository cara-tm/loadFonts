# loadFonts

If you take care about the number of HTTP requests, this little js script gives to external font files a delay (can be set) in order to avoid the waiting time for pages rendering (with FOUT effect) sometimes pretty long with a poor Internet bandwidth. Keeps the advantage of browser files catching and informs about the process throught the console log.
